      <H2>Wise ASP - ASP and JScript Coding Standards and Performance 
      Tips</H2>Staying on that bleeding edge can be a great kick, but it can 
      also leave you scratching your head. You may have come up with something 
      totally cool for your Web site -- but since no other Web site has the 
      feature, you end up wondering where to get help. I am always looking for 
      ways to improve the performance of Web pages and to improve on coding 
      styles. I have been able to compile from different sources some great 
      suggestions (some my own) from people on the Internet, including ways to 
      improve ASP performance and style tips. 
      <H3>File names</H3>File names should be short, descriptive, lower case and 
      contain no spaces. Consistent case will increase the speed of the web 
      server by improving the caching mechanism. IIS thinks that "fileName.asp" 
      and "filename.asp" are two different files, so it has to do a lot of 
      wasted work. Avoid this by always writing filenames entirely in all 
      lowercase. 
      <P><A name=SQL>
      <H3>SQL Notes</H3>All SQL calls should use consistent case: this will 
      increase the speed of the database server by improving the caching 
      mechanism. The database server thinks that <PRE>"SELECT name FROM items" 
 and 
"select name from items" 
</PRE>are two different queries, so it has to do a lot of wasted work. 
      Avoid this by always writing queries entirely in all lowercase or else 
      upper case for protected words (such as SELECT) and lower case for all 
      others. Do not use "SELECT *" in production code. Instead select only the 
      column names that you need. This will improve your query speed and overall 
      web/database communication speed. Be sure to close ADO <B>Connection</B> 
      and <B>Recordset</B> objects when you are done with them. 
      <B>Important:</B> Be very careful about accepting user input and adding it 
      to a query. User-entered apostrophes or percent signs will mess up your 
      query and can pose a security risk. Always check all user input for "%" 
      and "'". 
      <P><A name=localVariables>
      <H3>Use Local Variables Whenever Possible</H3>Local variables are 
      variables that reside within subroutines and functions (this is known as 
      local scope). These variables are compiled into numeric references and put 
      in a table. Local variable references can be resolved at compile time. 
      Global variables are resolved at run time. This means that local-variable 
      access is many times faster than global-variable access. Also, 
      undimensioned global variables are the slowest of all -- the first time an 
      undimensioned global variable is used, the entire object model is searched 
      for an object with that named property before a new one is created. So use 
      local-variables to get that better performance. 
      <P><A name=collectionValues>
      <H3>Copy Collections Values to Local Variables </H3>If there are 
      collection values that you are using more than once, copy these values 
      onto the client in the form of local variables. This saves you a look-up 
      operation on the collection each time you use the value and will speed up 
      your script. 
      <P><A name=combineStatements>
      <H3>Combine ASP Statements </H3>Try not to intersperse HTML and script too 
      much, if at all. Instead, try to have blocks of script and few client-side 
      HTML. Actually, the best solution to this is write as much of your 
      server-side ASP within &lt;script language=jscript runat=server&gt; ... 
      &lt;/script&gt; To see more details about this tip, go to my <A 
      href="http://www.aspalliance.com/wiseasp/template.asp">article</A>. 
      <P><A name=global.asa>
      <H3>global.asa</H3>In order to make <B>Application</B> and <B>Session</B> 
      work in ASP, we use a single file name <B>global.asa</B> for each 
      "application". <B>global.asa</B> contains the state of the application via 
      the <B>Application</B> and <B>Session</B> object properties and any global 
      code the "application" requires to alter it. This file resides in the 
      directory on the server that is the root of that application -- where the 
      files that make up the application are located. Any subdirectoires of the 
      main application directory are also part of the application, and the 
      <B>gloabal.asa</B> applies to their contents as well. This means you need 
      to be aware of the possibility of overlap between applications, and should 
      generally create separate directoires for each one. So when we talk about 
      an application in ASP, we are actually talking about all the files in the 
      same directory as global.asa, and any of its physical 
      subdirectories.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can use the <B>global.asa</B> to 
      gain a significant speed improvement. <B>global.asa</B> is not displayed 
      to users but stores application-global event information and objects. This 
      means the read from the .asp file happens <B>once per server</B> instead 
      of once per page per user. You can run a separate .asp file to refresh the 
      contents of the Application variable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confused about how 
      to implement this? If the contents of the cached information need to 
      change, you can call into an Administrator-access-only .asp file 
      containing script that can do an <B>Application.Lock</B>, update the 
      cached information and finally do an 
      <B>Application.Unlock</B>.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not hardcode the dsn 
      string, the database user id, or the database password in your .asp files. 
      Instead store them in application variables in Application_OnStart(). <PRE>SCRIPT LANGUAGE=JSCRIPT RUNAT=SERVER 
function Application_OnStart() 
{ 
  Application("dbName") = "dbName"; \ Database Name(ODBC name,etc. 
  Application("dbUserID") = "userID"; \ Database User ID 
  Application("dbUserPw") = "password"; \ Database User Password 
} 
/SCRIPT 
</PRE>You can now easily change and maintain the dsn information for an 
      entire application. 
      <P><A name=sessionObject>
      <H3>Be Careful of the Session Object </H3>You can use the <B>Session</B> 
      object to store information that you may need for a particular 
      user-session. Variables that are stored in the <B>Session</B> object are 
      not discarded when the user jumps between pages in the application. 
      Instead, these variables persist for the entire user-session. The Web 
      server automatically creates a <B>Session</B> object when a Web page from 
      the application is requested by a user who does not already have a 
      session. The server destroys the <B>Session</B> object when the session 
      expires or is abandoned. To avoid this, you can turn off the Session 
      feature. Turning it off for the entire server is faster but drops a lot of 
      functionality. Instead, be very careful to use the Session object only 
      when you really need to. If you use the <B>Session</B> object at all in 
      your application, be sure to use it as soon as possible in order to avoid 
      the <B>Session</B> object from being reset. In IIS, the session state can 
      be enabled on a per-application basis and it can be disabled for specified 
      .asp files. 
      <P><A name=servervariables>
      <H3>Avoid Using Server Variables </H3>Accessing server variables causes 
      your Web site to make a special request to the server and collect all 
      server variables, not just the one that you requested. This is akin to 
      needing to retrieve a specific item in a folder that you have in that 
      messy garage of yours. When you want that one item, you have to go to the 
      garage to get the folder first, before you can access the item. This is 
      the same thing that happens when you request a server variable, the 
      performance hit occurs the first time you request a server variable. 
      Subsequent requests for other server variables does not cause a 
      performance hit. 
      <P><A name=literalpaths>
      <H3>Use Literal Paths</H3>Try to avoid MapPath if at all possible. 
      Instead, use the literal path if you know it. Using MapPath requires IIS 
      to retreive the current server path, which means a special request to IIS 
      -- which in turn means (you guessed it) decreased performance. 
      <P><A name=object>
      <H3>Instantiate Objects Using the &lt;OBJECT&gt; Tag </H3>If you need to 
      refer to objects that may not be used, instantiate them by using the 
      &lt;OBJECT&gt; tag rather than using Server.CreateObject. Using 
      Server.CreateObject causes the object to be created immediately. If you 
      don't use that object later, you end up wasting resources. 
      <P><A name=broswer>
      <H3>Use Client-Side Validation Abilities </H3>If you are running a 
      generation 4 browser, the browser is capable of doing some validation for 
      you. Take advantage of this whenever you can. Perform validation with your 
      server-side scripting. When all else fails, then you can go ahead and 
      access your database on the server. But remember, whenever you access that 
      database that lives on the server, you are going to take a performance 
      hit. This can be very expensive if you have several values in a form that 
      you are validating. If you know that you will need to run some script on 
      the client side, go ahead and move the code to the client side for faster 
      performance. When you are running on the client, you have the processor(s) 
      for your use; the server has to use its processing power for all of the 
      requests it receives. 
      <P><A name=comments>
      <H3>Use Server-Side Comments Instead HTML Comments</H3>It does seem that 
      if you remove all HTML comments (script comments are fine), large sections 
      of HTML text can be "block copied" to the client. Of course, for your own 
      edification (and to keep code maintainence from being a nightmare) you 
      need comments. So go ahead and use server-side comments. Not only could 
      you receive a perfomance boost but you will keep your comments to 
      yourself. Not everyone needs to know your secrets. 
      <P><A name=includes>
      <H3>Standards for "include" files:</H3>You should use include files only 
      when absolutely necessary. Do not put too many functions into a file. 
      Otherwise, compile time is much slower, which hurts performance. Files 
      that contain any asp code should be named with the .asp file extension. 
      This is for security reasons. Use the .inc extension if the included file 
      contains pure HTML and no asp. Include files should not contain and &lt;% 
      , %&gt; or &lt;%@ tags. Include files should have no <A 
      href="http://www.aspalliance.com/wiseasp/template.asp"><B>main()</B></A> , 
      and should not call <B>main()</B>. Functions should be surrounded by 
      &lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE=JScript RUNAT=SERVER&gt; and &lt;/SCRIPT&gt; tags. All 
      functions must have unique names, and should not conflict with the names 
      of functions in other files which includes this file. All functions should 
      be well documented. 
      <P><A name=getStringField()>
      <H3>function getStringField()</H3>This function will convert a string that 
      is defined as "null" or "undefined" in JScript to a blank string. 
      <B>getStringField()</B> becomes especially useful when dealing with data 
      as it comes from a recordset. It should be included in all of your ASP 
      programs that interact with a database. You will no longer have to worry 
      about the dreaded undefined. <PRE>function getStringField(theRSField) { 
  theStr = String(theRSField); 
  if (theStr == "null" || theStr == "undefined") 
    return ""; 
  else 
    return theStr; 
} 
</PRE>

      use it yourself. Thanks for reading and feel free to jump around <B>Wise
